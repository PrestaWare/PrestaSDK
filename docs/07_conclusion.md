## Chapter 7: Conclusion & Next Steps
Having reached this point, you are now familiar with all the core concepts and key features of PrestaSDK. This documentation has shown you how to simplify, accelerate, and standardize your PrestaShop module development process using this tool.
### 7.1. Summary of Benefits

- **Save Time**: Automating installation processes, model management, and admin panel creation frees up more time to focus on your core business logic.
- **Clean and Standardized Code**: By following the SDK's structure, your modules will have a consistent and predictable architecture, making teamwork and long-term maintenance easier.
- **Powerful Admin Panel**: You get a beautiful, responsive, and functional admin panel that is easily extendable, without needing to write complex code.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Automatic asset management and the use of BaseModel simplify the process of updating and debugging modules in the future.

### 7.2. Practical Example: WaBulkUpdate Module

The best way to fully grasp the power of PrestaSDK is to examine a real-world project. The WaBulkUpdate module, referenced throughout this documentation, is a complete, open-source example developed using this very SDK.

This module utilizes all the key features of the SDK, including:

- Automatic installers for tabs and tables
- Admin controllers based on AdminController
- Data management with BaseModel
- Admin panel structure with PanelCore and a sidebar menu

We highly recommend reviewing its source code to see how the concepts explained in this documentation are implemented in practice.
